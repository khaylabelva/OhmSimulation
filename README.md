Ohm Simulation
Ohm Simulation is an interactive web-based platform designed to provide an educational and engaging experience for learning about Ohm’s Law. This platform includes a simulation tool, learning videos, and mini quizzes to enhance users' understanding of electrical circuits and the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

Features
Dashboard:
A user-friendly landing page that provides access to all the features.

Simulation:
An interactive simulation to experiment with Ohm’s Law. Users can adjust values for voltage, current, and resistance to observe their relationships.

Learning Videos:
A collection of educational videos to help users understand the concepts behind Ohm’s Law and its real-world applications.

Mini Quiz:
Short quizzes designed to test users' understanding with high-order thinking questions (HOTS).
